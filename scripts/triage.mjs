// Reconciles the 'status: needs-triage' and 'status: waiting-for-author-response'
// labels across all open issues and PRs.
//
// 'status: needs-triage' is fully owned by this automation: it is added to every
// item that matches a rule below and removed from every item that does not, on
// each run.
//
// 'status: waiting-for-author-response' is applied by hand; the automation only
// clears it, once the author has contributed at least once after the label went
// on. While it is set the item is never flagged, so parking an item on its
// author also parks it out of triage.
//
// An item is flagged with 'status: needs-triage' when it does not have the label
// 'status: waiting-for-author-response' and:
//   1. It is an issue:
//      a. without a priority label, or
//      b. P0/P1 without an assignee, or
//      c. P0 and stale for more than 1 day, or
//      d. P1 and stale for more than 30 days, or
//      e. P2 and stale for more than 90 days.
//   2. It is a stale PR opened by an external contributor (PRs from
//      maintainers are managed by their authors).
//   3. It is an issue whose latest human comment is from an external author
//      and has gone unanswered for more than 1 day.
//
// "Stale" is measured from the last human contribution (a comment, or — on PRs —
// a review or inline review comment, or the opening post if there are none)
// rather than `updated_at`, so the bot's own label edits never reset the clock.
// A PR is "stale" when no internal member has responded after the external
// author's last contribution for more than a day.
//
// Flagged issues and PRs:
// https://github.com/a2ui-project/a2ui/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22status%3A%20needs-triage%22
//
// The job prints to console what items are flagged/unflagged and why. To see the
// history of runs see:
